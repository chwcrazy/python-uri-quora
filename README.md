This repository contains my attempt at Quora's Python URI challenge. (http://www.quora.com/challenges#python_uri)

It attempts to split a URI into its component parts to consume or modify. It supports http, https, ftp & smtp. The idea is to be able to programatically modify parts of the URI. More to come here.

There is also an accompanying script with unit tests.
